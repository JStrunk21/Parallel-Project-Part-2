                                            Parallel Project Part 2
The project entails designing, developing, and evaluating a client-server system where clients create arrays of data to be sorted and the server subnet performs parallel sorting. The simulation consists of several instances with different array sizes and numbers of parallel threads. Performance metrics such as Parallel Execution Time, Speed Up, and Efficiency are gathered, compared and used to assess the efficacy of the implemented algorithms. The experimental design provides in-depth knowledge on how it was done; application implementation details; methods employed during simulation; techniques for analyzing data; findings made.
